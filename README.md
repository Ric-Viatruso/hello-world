First GitHub Repo

Hello tech-fam, I'm Ric, a superhuman. I'm a veteran coder returning from a decade+ hiatus,  I've been working as a nurse and quality analyst ever since. 
Now I'm interested into changing my career into a data science role or even into a full-time programmer. I'm looking forward to networking with others and developing AI machines and data programs geared towards biotechnology for helathcare/medical purposes.
